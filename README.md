# ✈️ Airline Ticketing System (FastAPI Microservices)


## 🧩 Overview

This project is a microservices-based Airline Ticketing System built using FastAPI (v0.115.0) and PostgreSQL.
It’s part of my personal learning journey — transitioning from .NET 6 background to mastering Python backend development.

Each service is designed to be independent, lightweight, and RESTful, with interactive API documentation powered by Swagger UI.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|-----------|-------------|
| Framework | FastAPI (v0.115.0) |
| Language | Python 3 |
| Database | PostgreSQL |
| API Docs | Swagger UI (auto-generated by FastAPI) |
| Architecture | Microservices |

## 🧱 Services

Service	Description	Status
🧑‍💼 User Service	Manages user registration, login, and authentication	✅ Completed
🛫 Flight Service	Handles flight schedules, routes, and airline data	🚧 In progress
📘 Booking Service	Manages ticket booking, payments, and seat availability	🚧 In progress

Each service runs on a different port and communicates via REST APIs.
Eventually, these services will be containerized and connected using Docker Compose.

## 🚀 How to Run (Development Mode)

1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/airline-ticketing-system.git
cd airline-ticketing-system

2️⃣ Setup Virtual Environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # for Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate      # for Windows

3️⃣ Install Dependencies (per service)
cd user-service
pip install -r requirements.txt

4️⃣ Run the Service
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

Understand how to build scalable APIs using FastAPI

Learn microservices architecture using Python

Integrate PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM

Practice good project structure, versioning, and documentation

Transition skills from .NET ecosystem to Python backend development

## 📈 Next Steps

 Complete flight-service and booking-service

 Add JWT authentication and service-to-service communication

 Containerize with Docker and setup API Gateway

 Deploy to a cloud platform (Alibaba)

## 💬 About This Project

This is a self-learning project — I’m exploring how modern backend systems are built in Python.
While I’m still learning, I focus on clean code, readable structure, and production-oriented architecture.

🧡 My goal: to grow as a software engineer who can adapt across tech stacks and still write maintainable, scalable systems.
